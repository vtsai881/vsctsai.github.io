Hi, I'm Valerie! I am an incoming Neuroscience PhD Student at Stanford University. I am interested in using computational modeling and closed-loop optogenetics to understand how social behaviors are structured and orchestrated by genes, neural circuits, modulatory systems, sensory cues, and motor sequences.

I did my undergrad at the University of Washington, where I earned a BS in Neuroscience and a Minor in English. I conducted an honors thesis with Dr. Sam Golden where I used deep and machine learning to quantitatively phenotype the behavioral sequences and whole-brain cfos ensembles underlying maladaptive aggression. 

After graduating in 2022, I worked at the National Institute of Mental Health as an IRTA Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow in the Unit on Neuromodulation and Synaptic Integration, where I learned to use patch clamp electrophysiology and one- and two-photon microscopy to investigate the impact of endogenous opioid signaling on PFC microcircuitry and motivated behavior.
