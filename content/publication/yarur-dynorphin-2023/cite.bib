 abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) controls behavior via connections with limbic excitatory afferents that engage various inhibitory motifs to shape mPFC circuit function. The dynorphin (Dyn) / kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system is highly enriched in the mPFC, and its dysregulation is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it is unclear how the Dyn / KOR system modulates excitatory and inhibitory circuits that are integral for mPFC information processing and behavioral control. Here, we provide a circuit-based framework wherein mPFC Dyn / KOR signaling regulates excitation-inhibition balance by toggling which afferents drive mPFC neurons. Dyn / KOR regulation of afferent inputs is pathway-specific. Dyn acting on presynaptic KORs inhibits glutamate release from afferent inputs to the mPFC, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and contralateral cortex. The majority of excitatory synapses to mPFC neurons, including those from the ventral hippocampus (VH), do not express presynaptic KOR, rendering them insensitive to Dyn / KOR modulation. Dyn / KOR signaling also suppresses afferent-driven recruitment of specific inhibitory sub-networks, providing a basis for Dyn to disinhibit mPFC circuits. Specifically, Dyn / KOR signaling preferentially suppresses SST interneuron- relative to PV interneuron-mediated inhibition. Selective KOR action on afferents or within mPFC microcircuits gates how distinct limbic inputs drive spiking in mPFC neurons. Presynaptic Dyn / KOR signaling decreases KOR-positive input-driven (e.g. BLA) spiking of mPFC neurons. In contrast, KOR-negative input recruitment of mPFC neurons is enhanced by Dyn / KOR signaling via suppression of mPFC inhibitory microcircuits. Thus, by acting on distinct circuit elements, Dyn / KOR signaling shifts KOR-positive and negative afferent control of mPFC circuits, providing mechanistic insights into the role of neuropeptides in shaping mPFC function. Together, these findings highlight the utility of targeting the mPFC Dyn / KOR system as a means to treat neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation in mPFC integration of long-range afferents with local inhibitory microcircuits.},
