abstract: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) controls behavior via connections with
  limbic excitatory afferents that engage various inhibitory motifs to shape mPFC
  circuit function. The dynorphin (Dyn) / kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system is highly
  enriched in the mPFC, and its dysregulation is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.
  However, it is unclear how the Dyn / KOR system modulates excitatory and inhibitory
  circuits that are integral for mPFC information processing and behavioral control.
  Here, we provide a circuit-based framework wherein mPFC Dyn / KOR signaling regulates
  excitation-inhibition balance by toggling which afferents drive mPFC neurons. Dyn
  / KOR regulation of afferent inputs is pathway-specific. Dyn acting on presynaptic
  KORs inhibits glutamate release from afferent inputs to the mPFC, including the
  basolateral amygdala (BLA), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and contralateral
  cortex. The majority of excitatory synapses to mPFC neurons, including those from
  the ventral hippocampus (VH), do not express presynaptic KOR, rendering them insensitive
  to Dyn / KOR modulation. Dyn / KOR signaling also suppresses afferent-driven recruitment
  of specific inhibitory sub-networks, providing a basis for Dyn to disinhibit mPFC
  circuits. Specifically, Dyn / KOR signaling preferentially suppresses SST interneuron-
  relative to PV interneuron-mediated inhibition. Selective KOR action on afferents
  or within mPFC microcircuits gates how distinct limbic inputs drive spiking in mPFC
  neurons. Presynaptic Dyn / KOR signaling decreases KOR-positive input-driven (e.g.
  BLA) spiking of mPFC neurons. In contrast, KOR-negative input recruitment of mPFC
  neurons is enhanced by Dyn / KOR signaling via suppression of mPFC inhibitory microcircuits.
  Thus, by acting on distinct circuit elements, Dyn / KOR signaling shifts KOR-positive
  and negative afferent control of mPFC circuits, providing mechanistic insights into
  the role of neuropeptides in shaping mPFC function. Together, these findings highlight
  the utility of targeting the mPFC Dyn / KOR system as a means to treat neuropsychiatric
  disorders characterized by dysregulation in mPFC integration of long-range afferents
  with local inhibitory microcircuits.
