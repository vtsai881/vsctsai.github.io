abstract: Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved, adaptive component of social
  behavior. Studies in male mice illustrate that aggression is influenced by numerous
  factors including the degree to which an individual finds aggression rewarding and
  will work for access to attack and subordinate mice. While such studies have expanded
  our understanding of the molecular and circuit mechanisms of male aggression very
  little is known about female aggression, within these established contexts. Here
  we use an ethologically relevant model of male vs. female aggression by pair housing
  adult male and female outbred CFW mice with opposite sex cage mates. We assess reactive
  (defensive) aggression in the resident intruder (RI) test and appetitive (rewarding)
  aggression in the aggression conditioned place preference (CPP) and operant self-administration
  (SA) tests. Our results show dramatic sex differences in both qualitative and quantitative
  aspects of reactive vs. appetitive aggression. Males exhibit more wrestling and
  less investigative behavior during RI, find aggression rewarding, and will work
  for access to a subordinate to attack. Females exhibit more bites, alternate between
  aggressive behaviors and investigative behaviors more readily during RI, however,
  they do not find aggression to be rewarding or reinforcing. These results establish
  sex differences in aggression in mice, providing an important resource for the field
  to better understand the circuit and molecular mechanisms of aggression in both
  sexes.
