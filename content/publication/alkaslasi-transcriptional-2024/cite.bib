	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for neurodegeneration, however little is known about how different neuron types respond to this kind of injury. In this study, we follow neuronal populations over several months after a single mild TBI (mTBI) to assess long ranging consequences of injury at the level of single, transcriptionally defined neuronal classes. We find that the stress responsive Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) defines a population of cortical neurons after mTBI. We show that neurons that activate ATF3 upregulate stress-related genes while repressing many genes, including commonly used markers for these cell types. Using an inducible reporter linked to ATF3, we genetically mark damaged cells to track them over time. Notably, we find that a population in layer V undergoes cell death acutely after injury, while another in layer II/III survives long term and retains the ability to fire action potentials. To investigate the mechanism controlling layer V neuron death, we genetically silenced candidate stress response pathways. We found that the axon injury responsive kinase MAP3K12, also known as dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), is required for the layer V neuron death. This work provides a rationale for targeting the DLK signaling pathway as a therapeutic intervention for traumatic brain injury. Beyond this, our novel approach to track neurons after a mild, subclinical injury can inform our understanding of neuronal susceptibility to repeated impacts.},
