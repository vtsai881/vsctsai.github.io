abstract: 'Background A key challenge in developing treatments for neuropsychiatric
  illness is the disconnect between preclinical models and the complexity of human
  social behavior. We integrate voluntary social self-administration into a rodent
  model of social stress as a platform for the identification of fundamental brain
  and behavior mechanisms underlying stress-induced individual differences in social
  motivation. Methods Here, we introduced an operant social stress procedure in male
  and female mice composed of 3 phases: 1) social self-administration training, 2)
  social stress exposure concurrent with reinforced self-administration testing, and
  3) poststress operant testing under nonreinforced and reinforced conditions. We
  used social-defeat and witness-defeat stress in male and female mice. Results Social
  defeat attenuated social reward seeking in males but not females, whereas witness
  defeat had no effect in males but promoted seeking behavior in females. We resolved
  social stress-induced changes to social motivation by aggregating z-scored operant
  metrics into a cumulative social index score to describe the spectrum of individual
  differences exhibited during operant social stress. Clustering does not adequately
  describe the relative distributions of social motivation following stress and is
  better described as a nonbinary behavioral distribution defined by the social index
  score, capturing a dynamic range of stress-related alterations in social motivation
  inclusive of sex as a biological variable. Conclusions We demonstrated that operant
  social stress can detect stable individual differences in stress-induced changes
  to social motivation. The inclusion of volitional behavior in social procedures
  may enhance the understanding of behavioral adaptations that promote stress resiliency
  and their mechanisms under more naturalistic conditions.'
